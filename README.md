# React-Portfolio

## Description

This application was created as a professional portfolio. It is designed to showcase projects completed within the bootcamp program in order to provide potential employers with a demonstration of my skills and abilities. The HOME page features animation, ABOUT ME is a short biography of myself along with a photograph, PORTFOLIO showcases six projects completed along with the deployed site link and GitHub link, CONTACT is a form that allows the recipient to connect with me for further steps and RESUME provides a copy of my resume along with the ability to download a copy of the PDF file.
