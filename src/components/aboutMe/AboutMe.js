          My career began with a Bachelor of Science from the University of Colorado
          at Denver, followed by roles in mortgage processing and human resources 
          before making the pivot into software development. Completing the University
          of Denver Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp and earning a certification in the 
          MERN tech stack laid the groundwork for my current pursuit of the Oracle
          Certified Professional Java SE 11 credential.

          Recent work includes developing a Social Media Blog RESTful API at 
          Revatureâ€”first with Java, Maven, JDBC, Javalin and MySQL. Then re-built
          this project using Spring Boot, Spring Security, JPA, Hibernate and MySQL.
          Another project recently completed for the University of Colorado at Denver
          was refactoring a Python-based architectural modeling application, reducing 
          the codebase by 30%, improving load time by 95% and adding enhanced features 
          for a better user experience.
